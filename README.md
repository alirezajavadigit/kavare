# kavare


Kaware framework is a framework similar to Laravel. I myself admit that it doesn't have the power and security of Laravel because I worked on this project alone, but Laravel is a very powerful development community. But I tried to get a better understanding of Laravel's system and core by reverse engineering, I don't recommend you to use this framework to develop your programs as long as there is a powerful framework like Laravel, why this framework? But reading the codes can give you a better understanding of Laravel's core
